# mini-jest

Run the tests:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

## Description

Create a simplified version of a testing framework similar to Jest using vanilla JavaScript. Your framework should allow for the definition, execution, and reporting of test cases with various assertions.

**Instructions:**

Implement the TestRunner class with the specified methods and features.

- Create the assertion functions in a separate module.
- Define and group test cases using the test and describe functions.
- Implement a reporting mechanism that outputs results to the console.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide informative messages.
- Ensure the framework is extensible and consider additional features for real-world scenarios.
